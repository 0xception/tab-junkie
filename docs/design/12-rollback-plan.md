## 12. Rollback Plan

### What can go wrong and how to recover

1. **Revert B-001b or B-001c as a code change.** `git revert` the relevant commits on `feature/rebuild-from-prd`. Any `tj:*` partitions already written remain on-disk and are re-read normally by the earlier code (B-001a storage layer is unchanged). `tj:tabClaims` in `storage.session` is ephemeral and is cleared on browser restart; no residue risk.

2. **Regression in a specific write path.** Disable the extension and debug via unpacked-mode reload. No remote kill-switch exists (by design — the extension is local-only).

3. **Corrupt partition in the field.** `ERR_CORRUPT_DATA` is scoped per partition (AC8); the other five remain usable. Export-and-reset UX is deferred to the sidepanel item (B-022); until then, recovery is manual via DevTools.

4. **Quota exhaustion in the field.** `ERR_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` bubbles from `writeTransaction`. The `quotaWarning` flag is now surfaced via `MSG_GET_STATUS`; quota warning UX banner is deferred to B-022. Short-term mitigation: delete items from a working installation.

5. **Migration failure (`ERR_TX_CONFLICT` from a migration step).** `readyPromise` rejects; all write messages return `ERR_NOT_READY`. The on-disk `tj:meta.schemaVersion` is left at its pre-migration value (the failing `writeTransaction` aborts atomically). The correct fix is to patch the migration step and reload the extension.

6. **Corrupt `tj:meta.schemaVersion`.** `readyPromise` rejects with `ERR_CORRUPT_DATA`. Recovery requires manual DevTools correction of `tj:meta` in `chrome.storage.local`.

### B-001b-specific: safe-mode protects against schema downgrades

If a user is running a newer extension version that bumped `KNOWN_VERSION` to N, then downgrades to the current codebase (KNOWN_VERSION = 1):

- `stored.schemaVersion = N > 1` → `isSafeMode()` returns `true`.
- `readyPromise` resolves (not rejects) — reads still work.
- All write operations return `ERR_SAFE_MODE` until the user upgrades again.
- No data is written under a schema the current code does not understand. On-disk data from the newer version is preserved intact for when the user re-upgrades.

### B-001d-specific: drift records survive SW restart but not item deletion

`tj:drift` records are in `storage.local` and survive SW restarts. Stale records for deleted items are filtered out lazily at `MSG_LIST_ITEMS` read time. There is no proactive cleanup on item delete; a missed delete (e.g. crash mid-delete) leaves an orphan drift record that is harmlessly ignored at read time.

### B-002-specific: unresolved floating-group records have no TTL

Unresolved `tj:floatingGroups` records persist indefinitely. Revert of B-002 code leaves these records inert on disk (they are never read by non-B-002 code paths). Manual cleanup via DevTools `chrome.storage.local.set({'tj:floatingGroups': []})` is the recovery path if accumulation becomes a problem.

### What B-001a/b/c/d + B-002 do NOT protect against

- Partial writes across multiple storage APIs — not applicable; every `tj:*` write is a single `chrome.storage.local.set`.
- Loss of `LiveTabIndex` on SW restart — by design (ephemeral, rebuilt on next cold start from `chrome.tabs.query`).
- Loss of `TabClaims` on browser restart — by design (`storage.session` is cleared by Chrome; cold-start reconcile re-establishes claims).
- Stale `tj:drift` records for deleted items — filtered lazily at read time, not proactively deleted.
- Unresolved `tj:floatingGroups` records accumulating indefinitely — no TTL or cleanup job exists yet.
