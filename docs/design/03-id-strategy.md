## 3. ID Strategy

- **Format:** ULID — 26-char Crockford Base32, 10-char 48-bit timestamp
  prefix + 16-char 80-bit random suffix (`background/storage/ids.js`).
- **Monotonicity:** strict-monotonic within a single service-worker process.
  Within the same millisecond, the random portion of the later ULID is
  `previous + 1`. On random-portion overflow (1-in-2^80), the logical clock
  advances 1 ms.
- **Entropy source:** `crypto.getRandomValues(Uint8Array(16))`. Never seeded
  from user input.
- **Identity invariants (AC3 + R2 §1):**
  - IDs are never reused after delete (fresh ULID every create).
  - IDs are never derived from or contain any substring of item URL/title.
  - Every `create*` call emits exactly one ULID.
- `ERR_ID_COLLISION` is declared in the taxonomy but **intentionally
  unreachable** — defensive reserved code per ruling #5. No caller tests for
  it; no path throws it.
