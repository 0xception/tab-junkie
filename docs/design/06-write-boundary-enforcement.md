## 6. Write-Boundary Enforcement

Dual-layer defense so a single bypass cannot reach `chrome.storage.local.set`.

### Static layer — ESLint

`.eslintrc.json` applies `no-restricted-imports` via an `overrides` block
scoped to `sidepanel/**`, `newtab/**`, `popup/**`, and `components/**`. The
denylist forbids any import from `**/background/storage/**` or
`**/background/messages/**`. UI code can only reach the storage layer via
`shared/messages.js` + `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.

### Runtime layer — sender + SW-context checks

- **Sender guard** (`storage-handlers.js:108`): every `onMessage` call that
  does not carry `sender.id === chrome.runtime.id` is rejected with
  `ERR_DIRECT_WRITE`. Sufficient today because `externally_connectable` is
  not declared in the manifest (M9 documented invariant).
- **SW-context guard** (`write-transaction.js:64`): `writeTransaction` calls
  `assertServiceWorkerContext()` on every invocation. It verifies
  `self instanceof ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` **and** `chrome.runtime.id` is
  defined. Failing either check throws `ERR_DIRECT_WRITE` before any storage
  op executes.

### Test hatch (H5)

The SW-context guard would always fail under jsdom/Node during the R5 test
suite. The hatch: the chrome-mock sets `chrome.__tabJunkieTestMock = true`
at setup, and `isTestEnvironment()` short-circuits the guard when it sees
that sentinel. Production code never sets the sentinel; real extensions run
through the full guard path.

### Known gap — M1 (deferred)

The ESLint rule uses a **UI-folder denylist** (`sidepanel/`, `newtab/`,
`popup/`, `components/`). Folders outside that list — especially `shared/**`
and `lib/**` — are not covered. A hypothetical future `shared/util.js` that
imported from `background/storage/` would pass the static check. Tracked as
**M1 in `docs/SPRINT_FINDINGS.md`** and handed off to **B-053**, which will
flip to allowlist semantics (only `background/**` may reach
`background/storage/**`). The runtime layer still blocks this bypass today,
so the gap is static-only.
