Local reference copy. Source of truth: GitHub Releases.

## v1.2.0 — Foundation Complete + URL Normalization (2026-04-15)

### What's new
- **Drift detection** — items flagged when their live tab navigates away from the saved URL; drift persists across restarts; clears automatically when tab navigates back
- **Floating-tab re-association** — group assignments survive browser restarts via exact window+index matching with URL fallback
- **URL normalization** — unified `normalizeUrl()` in `shared/url.js` with protocol defaulting, scheme validation, hostname lowercasing, fragment handling
- **Scheme allowlist update** — `http`/`https`/`file` accepted; `ftp`/`mailto` removed

### Internal
- New: `background/tabs/drift.js` (~120 LoC), `background/tabs/floating-groups.js` (~120 LoC), `shared/url.js`, `shared/errors.js`
- `StorageError` + `ERR_*` constants moved to `shared/errors.js` (canonical home)
- 35 new tests (119 total), all passing
- SOLUTION_DESIGN.md v1.3
- **Entire B-001 family (a/b/c/d) now complete** — full data layer shipped

### Known limitations
- No UI: sidepanel, newtab, popup still stubs
- No floating-group TTL (stale records may accumulate)
- `file:` URLs storable but may not be openable in MV3

### Test results
- Automated: 119/119 passing
- UAT: skipped

## v1.1.0 — Data Layer Completion (2026-04-15)

### What's new
- **Schema migration runner** — forward-only migration pipeline with `readyPromise` barrier; schema version tracked in `tj:meta.schemaVersion`; migrations execute atomically within `writeTransaction`
- **Downgrade safe-mode** — when the extension detects a newer schema version than it knows, all writes are blocked (`ERR_SAFE_MODE`); reads continue working; detectable via `MSG_GET_STATUS`
- **Quota monitoring** — 80% storage quota warning surfaced via `MSG_GET_STATUS` response
- **Legacy key migration** — `junkie_*` keys from v1 are shape-mapped to Items (best-effort) and removed on first startup
- **Live tab tracking** — in-memory `LiveTabIndex` rebuilt from `chrome.tabs.query` on every cold start; tracks `live`, `active`, `audible` per tab without any `storage.local` writes
- **Tab-claims disambiguation** — `TabClaims` in `storage.session` maps each saved item to a specific live tab; handles multiple items sharing one URL via first-unclaimed-wins in sort order
- **Enriched MSG_LIST_ITEMS** — response now includes `liveStates` map alongside items, providing real-time live/active/audible state per item at read time

### Internal
- New: `background/storage/migration.js` (~255 LoC)
- New: `background/tabs/` (4 modules, ~433 LoC)
- `ERR_SAFE_MODE` + `MSG_GET_STATUS` added to contracts
- Per-tab debounce on URL-change reevaluation (100ms, prevents claim races)
- `claimsReady` flag prevents stale reads before cold-start reconciliation completes
- Test suite: 81 automated tests, all passing (47 new)
- SOLUTION_DESIGN.md updated to v1.2

### Known limitations
- No UI: sidepanel, newtab, and popup are still empty stubs
- No drift tracking or floating-tab re-association (B-001d)
- Migration runner scaffold limited to single-partition atomicity (refactor needed for first real step)
- UAT skipped for this release (data-layer only)

### Test results
- Automated: 81/81 passing
- UAT: skipped

## v1.0.0 — Foundation Storage Layer (2026-04-15)

### What's new
- Partitioned storage schema: six isolated keys (`tj:meta`, `tj:items`, `tj:groups`, `tj:prefs`, `tj:drift`, `tj:floatingGroups`) under `chrome.storage.local`
- Full item and group CRUD with validation and strict group-depth enforcement (max depth 1)
- ULID-based IDs: sortable, stable, collision-free, never derived from URL or title
- Atomic writes via `writeTransaction()`: multi-step ops commit in a single `storage.local.set`, safe against mid-write service worker termination
- Service worker as sole writer: all UI surfaces send messages; the SW serializes all writes
- Message contract in `shared/messages.js` for UI-to-SW communication (12 message types)
- Placeholder UI stubs for sidepanel, newtab, and popup (extension loads cleanly)

### Internal
- Storage module: `background/storage/` (~910 LoC, 8 modules)
- Message handler: `background/messages/storage-handlers.js` (~145 LoC)
- ESLint `no-restricted-imports` enforcing write-boundary at lint time
- Test suite: 34 automated tests, all passing (node:test runner, zero deps)
- UAT: PASS (2026-04-15)

### Known limitations
- No UI: sidepanel, newtab, and popup are empty stubs
- No schema migration runner or downgrade safe-mode (B-001b)
- No live tab tracking or tab-claims disambiguation (B-001c)
- No drift tracking or floating-tab re-association (B-001d)

### Test results
- Automated: 34/34 passing
- UAT: PASS
